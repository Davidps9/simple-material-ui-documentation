Here is a guide on how to use the Simple Material UI Library with Astro applications.

## SetUp
### Adding React
This library is built in top of React, so you will need to add it to your project with the following code:

   ```bash
    npx astro add react
    ```
### Adding Tailwind
This library is also built in top of Tailwind, so you will need to add it to your Astro project with the following code:

     ```bash
    npx astro add tailwindcss
    ```
After installing Tailwind you will need to configure your Tailwind enviroment as said in the installation guide, on the [Tailwind setup section](/guides/installation/#tailwind-setup)

## Installation

Install the package via npm or yarn:

   ```bash
    npm install simple-material-ui-library
    ```
